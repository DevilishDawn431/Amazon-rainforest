# GUIDE TO INSTALL BELOW:

Part 1: setup
Well this setup may be hard for some users, but if you want to continue you may continue reading this, ok so to store the os on (because the firestick has only 8gb of storage) we need a usb drive, and along with that we need a otg adapter, i recommend this one: https://www.amazon.com/AuviPal-Powered-Adapter-Charging-Streaming/dp/B07TX8FY6W/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2BX3H3Z05ZLJ4&keywords=firestick+otg&qid=1684109073&sprefix=firestick+otg+%2Caps%2C983&sr=8-2
Also in order to install the os itself to the usb drive and boot it we need to jailbreak (mod) our firestick and since im too lazy to explain it here in a github repo just go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yz72VedSZw, then find a website explaining how to use the “Downloader” app on fire stick to download and install apk’s, also in order to find the apks we need you would need to go to apkpure.com in the downloader app (also dont try to find minecraft on there you theif.)
also you will need a better case with a heatsink if your gonna install the os or overclock it, i recommend this one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4185753 also you gotta pry open the firestick and buy the heatsink part, have fun :>
(note: if you dont have a 3d printer you can find a printing service or just have no case and just a heatsink)

Part 2: what makes this stick tick?
Well the heart of the fire tv stick (2nd generation) is a MediaTek MT8127D Quad-core ARM 1.3 GHz processor, it also has 1 gb of ram, and 8 gb of storage
