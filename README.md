# GUIDE TO INSTALL BELOW:

Part 1: setup
Well this setup may be hard for some users, but if you want to continue you may continue reading this, ok so to store the os on (because the firestick has only 8gb of storage) we need a usb drive, and along with that we need a otg adapter, i recommend this one: https://www.amazon.com/AuviPal-Powered-Adapter-Charging-Streaming/dp/B07TX8FY6W/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2BX3H3Z05ZLJ4&keywords=firestick+otg&qid=1684109073&sprefix=firestick+otg+%2Caps%2C983&sr=8-2
Also in order to install the os itself to the usb drive and boot it we need to jailbreak (mod) our firestick and since im too lazy to explain it here in a github repo just go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yz72VedSZw, then find a website explaining how to use the “Downloader” app on fire stick to download and install apk’s


Part 2: what makes this stick tick?
Well the heart of the fire tv stick (2nd generation) is a MediaTek MT8127D Quad-core ARM 1.3 GHz processor, it also has 1 gb of ram, and 8 gb of storage
